- Background color: A very light blue (#E8EAF6), provides a calm, neutral backdrop that ensures readability and reduces eye strain during prolonged use.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#7E57C2) is used to highlight important actions and notifications. This contrast enhances usability.

- Use a grid-based layout to keep things organized.
- Use easily recognizable icons throughout the interface, where they can reinforce button text or make sections more visually distinct.
